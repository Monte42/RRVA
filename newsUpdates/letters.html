          <p>
            Dear Homeowner: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you are having a good summer.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; In June, we asked homeowners who were interested in serving on our Board
            of Directors to submit their resumes for inclusion on the ballot for the
            election of directors at our annual meeting this Columbus Day weekend.
            As I indicated, we will be electing three persons for a two-year term to
            our Board of Directors. No one has submitted their resume. The three
            incumbent directors - Greg Gomez, Jerald Stein and myself have all agreed
            to stand for re-election.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; We are continuing to assess what additional work will be done in connection
            with our water system and hope to gain some clarity in the next few weeks.
            We will keep you informed of any decisions.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the charge for the annual trash removal will be reflected
            on your September statement.
            <br><br>
            Enjoy the rest of the summer!

        <div class="inner in-box2">
          <p>
            Dear Homeowner: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, the 2019 Annual Meeting of Homeowners will be held at 10
            a.m. on Saturday, October 12th in the Clubhouse and we urge you to attend
            this meeting. However, if you are unable to attend and have not as yet
            submitted your proxy, please submit your proxy in person, by fax (607-326-2927),
            by pdf (rrvainc@catskill.net), or by mail. Your proxy was sent to you on
            September 10th. If you need another copy, please contact Wendy.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please also note that registration of those homeowners who attend the
            Annual Meeting will take place at the entrance to the Clubhouse beginning
            at 9:30 a.m. If you attend and have not as yet submitted a proxy, you
            will be provided with ballots for the two matters on the agenda. In addition
            to the matters on the agenda, there will be reports on our financial
            condition, status of work by NYSEG and Denver Water and as usual, a Q&A
            period. Please plan to arrive early so that we can start the meeting promptly
            at 10 a.m.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; You will undoubtedly note that the monthly statement for October includes
            a charge for school taxes relating to our common grounds and for garbage
            collection fees. Because of certain legal complications relating to our
            garbage collection firm we were unable to determine the fees until recently.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; On November 5, 2019 there will be a number of important local elections
            held in Roxbury, including for Town Supervisor, Council members, Tax
            Collector, Town Clerk, etc. We urge you to consider voting here, where
            each vote is meaningful. Please visit the Delaware County Board of Elections
            website at www.co.delaware.ny.us for information about registering and
            obtaining an absentee ballot.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Winter is fast approaching and the following items should be addressed:</strong> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; If your chimney was not cleaned or inspected last year and was used with
            any consistency, please call your chimney sweep and arrange to have it done
            this year. If you want RRVA to provide your contractor with a key, please
            notify us 24 hours in advance, Monday through Friday. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Crawl spaces must be closed for the winter. If you choose not to do this
            yourself, please notify the office no later than October 31, 2019 and this
            task will be done for you at a charge of $30.00. Winter House Watch, if
            you choose to sign up for this valuable service, please submit the accompanying
            form and make the appropriate payment of $40.00 per month. Those of you not on
            “Winter House Watch” service that request occasional inspections will be billed
            $50.00 per inspection. Any emergency services provided by a RRVA employee will
            be billed at $50.00 per hour plus materials. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; With the consistent harsh winters of the last few years, a number of
            homes have suffered frozen pipes. Please consider this fact when determining
            whether to sign up for our winter house watch service.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember that it is your obligation to keep your decks clear of leaves
            and snow. If left on the decks, leaves, moss and snow may cause rot on the
            siding and deck boards which increases our and your maintenance costs.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Below are the names and phone numbers of chimney sweeps and firewood providers
            who have provided services for RRVA homeowners in recent years. We are providing
            their names for your convenience, but are not endorsing any of them. Other
            providers are listed in local newspapers (Catskill Mtn News, Mountain Eagle)
            and telephone directories.

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please instruct your wood delivery people that they may not drive their
            trucks on our lawns or on the walkways. If they do so and damage these
            areas, you will be responsible for the cost to repair them. If you have
            wood delivered, you must have it stacked and stored away from walkways/roads/driveways
            within 48 hours of the delivery. Please remove all wood chips, etc. as they

            <p>
              Dear Homeowner: <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a pleasure to see many of you at our annual meeting
              held on October 12th. In the event you did not attend, I am pleased to
              inform you that three incumbent directors, Greg Gomez, Jerry Stein and
              myself were re-elected to two-year terms. Continuing as directors until
              the 2020 Annual Homeowners’ Meeting are Chris Cook, Dorothy Flynn,
              Bruce Mishkin and Joan Roberts.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Proposal two on the agenda passed overwhelmingly. To recap,
              the proposal was to approve a special capital assessment of $180.00 per
              home payable in twelve consecutive $15.00 monthly installments beginning
              in January 2020.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed certain planned and suggested capital improvements
              and announced the Board’s intention to replace the decking at the pool with
              a composite material by next summer. We also announced that we were working
              on a new website as part of an initiative to make RRVA better known and to
              enhance the values of the homes in our community. We sought suggestions from
              homeowners as to what information/ links/live feeds they would like to see
              on the website. If you have any suggestions, please submit them to the office.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; At an organizational meeting of the Association's Directors
              held that same day, the following officers of the Association were
              elected to serve until the next Annual Homeowners’ Meeting: Bruce
              Mishkin, Vice- President; Dorothy Flynn, Treasurer; Joan Roberts;
              Secretary and myself as President.
              We hope to be able to share with you more concrete information as to
              the start of work on the next phase of improvements (installation of
              cut-off valves for each of the clusters and the replacement of the water
              valves at each of the homes) to our water system later this year. We
              are also awaiting an update from NYSEG as to when they expect to replace
              the power line to the lower clusters.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; An issue that was raised at the meeting, was the concern
              evidenced by many homeowners about cars speeding down our roads. We
              have identified speed bumps that can be installed this coming spring
              if speeding continues. We have no desire to install the speed bumps but
              will do so if necessary.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the homeowners raised his concern about our rental
              policy, seeking to permit unlimited rentals during the winter months.
              We promised to discuss this suggestion and others at our Memorial Day
              weekend town meeting in 2020.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; A copy of the Association’s snow removal policy and Winter
              Guidelines is enclosed. It is wise to prepare now for what may be another
              cold and snowy winter. Also attached is a Winter Watch form, for those of
              you who wish to utilize this valuable service and have not signed up yet.
              If applicable, please inform your tenants and guests about our snow removal
              policy and our Winter Guidelines.
              <br><br>
              Wishing you a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

          <p>
            Dear Homeowner: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; As we enter the snow season, we would like to remind you that ice damming
            on roofs is a problem for many of us. Remediation of this problem is not
            one of the Association's maintenance responsibilities. (See Article XVI
            of our By-laws). A helpful fact sheet concerning ice damming is attached
            to this letter. We have marked the pertinent information with an asterisk
            and suggest you contact your contractor, or any of the individuals listed
            below, and make arrangements directly with them to remove the accumulated
            snow when, and if, necessary.
            <br><br>

            <ul>

            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please be sure to advise your service provider that when they remove
            snow from your roof to make to remove the snow that falls on your deck
            and/or walkways. A build-up of snow and ice on your deck can cause your
            deck to collapse, which repair is not the responsibility of the Association.
            Please do not call the office in the event you experience ice damming
            on your roof.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember that ARTCLE XIX of the By-laws, a copy of which is attached
            to this letter, continues to be in effect with respect to winter rentals.
            The Association requires those of you who rent out your homes to submit
            a Tenant Information Form to the Association's office before doing so.
            Similarly, if you will be making your home available to guests (including
            family members who do not live with you) you are required to submit a
            Guest Information form to the Association's office. Copies of both forms
            are attached to this letter and are also available on our website.
            <br><br>
            Wishing you a wonderful Thanksgiving Day from the Board of Directors
            and the Staff.

            Dear Homeowner:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; During the winter season, please remember to call the office if you are
            arriving before Friday afternoon so that our staff can clean your walkway
            if necessary. Your walkway will not be cleared otherwise. Voice mail messages
            are checked throughout the business day. In event of snow, our roads are plowed
            before walkways are cleared. It is the Association's policy to clear walkways
            during the daytime once there is an accumulation of 2” of snow, but when
            possible, the staff attempts to remove snow sooner. Please do not park in
            front of walkways. It makes it nearly impossible for the staff to remove the
            snow and provide residents and emergency vehicles access to the homes.
            So as not to impede the snow removal process, all objects must be moved away
            from the walkways and your steps. During snow removal, it's impossible to see
            and move around these obstacles and they get caught in the snow blower blades,
            breaking the equipment - it is also extremely dangerous to the staff using
            the equipment. Please remove lights, mats, pumpkins, garbage cans, rocks,
            planters, extension cords, etc. by January 1, 2020. If the items are not
            removed by this date, the staff will do so and place them on your porch.
            RRVA cannot be responsible for damage to these items. We'd like to thank
            you in advance for your co-operation. On this month's statement you'll
            find the first of twelve installment charges of $15.00 for the special
            capital assessment. Also attached is a copy of the Minutes of the Annual
            Meeting of October 12, 2019. I also need to draw your attention to two
            problems that continue to plague us. The first problem relates to dog owners
            allowing dogs to roam unleashed within our community. The second problem
            relates to homeowners and guests who either do not pick up dog waste, or
            bag the waste and either throw it into the woods or leave it at the side
            of the road or next to a garbage can. The failure to either keep dogs under
            leash when outside of a townhouse or bag dog waste and remove it appropriately
            are punishable by a fine. Please consider our snow removal staff, your
            neighbors and friends and comply with our Associations policies and
            regulations.
            <br><br>
            On behalf of the Directors and Staff of Roxbury Run Village I
            would like to wish you all a most happy holiday season and new year.

            Dear Homeowner: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you all enjoyed the MLK weekend and that 2020 has gotten off to a good start for you! <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, the Denver Water District project is continuing to move forward. The 2” cluster valves for each of the clusters are in the midst of being replaced and individual valves will be replaced at many of our homes. I hope that you have not been inconvenienced by the work.
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry to report that we will not go forward with the replacement of the decking at the pool with a composite material, as the final price mushroomed to a point that made no economic sense for us.
            &nbsp;&nbsp; You will undoubtedly note that the monthly statement for February includes a charge for property taxes relating to our common grounds.  The charge for property taxes increased by only $2.00 this year. <br><br>
            <strong>USPS Street Address Registration</strong> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Below is pertinent information about the contact in USPS who will register the address of RRVA residents into the USPS directory so that delivery and other services can confirm your delivery and street address information.  You’ll need to provide them with your street address and cluster and unit number.

            &nbsp;&nbsp; As we have indicated in the past and because we anticipate more snow, we suggest that you contact a contractor or any of those listed below to make arrangements directly with them to remove the accumulated snow from your roof when and if necessary.  Please advise your service provider that the snow removed from the roof that falls on the deck and/or walkways must be removed.  Ice damming on roofs is not covered by the Association’s maintenance responsibilities.
