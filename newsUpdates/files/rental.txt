ARTICLE XIX – Rental Guidelines

1. No weekend rental of a Townhouse Unit is permitted; only rentals for more than 13 days are allowed.
2. Every advertisement or other offering for rental of a Townhouse Unit must state, in clearly legible
font, “Rentals for less than 2 weeks are prohibited.” Failure to include such notice shall result in a
fine to the Owner of not less than $500 per advertisement. Each placement of a violating advertisement
shall be considered a separate violation (i.e., placing the same advertisement in 3 different  venues
would constitute 3 violations). It shall be the renting Owner’s responsibility to inform their agents
of this notice requirement. A violation of the notice requirement by an Owner’s agent shall be considered
a violation by the Owner.
3. More than four two week rentals of a Townhouse Unit within any 12 month period shall be considered
running a business in violation of Article VII, section 4 of the Amendment to Declaration of Covenants,
Conditions and Restriction of Roxbury Run Village.
4.  This Article shall take effect 60 days after its passage.
