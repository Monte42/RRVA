          cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the
          Common Area, including fixtures and personal property related thereto, provided that any such

          Section 9. Annual Maintenance Assessment: Due Dates.<br>
          <div class="sub-list">
            (a) The Board of Directors shall fix the amount of the annual maintenance assessment for
            each Townhouse Unit at least thirty (30) days in advance of each annual assessment period. Written
            notice of the annual maintenance assessment shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto. The due
            dates shall be established by the Board of Directors, and, unless otherwise provided, the Village
            Association shall collect each month from the Owner of each Townhouse Unit one-twelfth (1/12th) of
            the annual maintenance assessment for such Townhouse Unit.<br>
            (b) The Village Association shall, upon demand of a Townhouse Unit Owner or a contract
            purchaser of a Townhouse Unit, and for a reasonable charge, furnish a statement signed by an officer
            of the Village Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specified Townhouse Unit have
            been paid. Such statement shall be conclusive evidence of payment of any assessment therein stated
            to have been paid.
          </div><br>
          Section 10. Effect of Nonpayment of Assessments: Remedies of the Village Association.
          Any assessments which are not paid when due shall be delinquent. If the assessment is not paid
          within thirty (30) days after the due date, the assessment shall bear interest from the date of
          delinquency at the then maximum legal rate per annum, or a late charge in such amount as shall have
          last been fixed and published by the Board of Directors prior to such delinquency and the Village
          Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same, or
          foreclose the lien against the Townhouse Unit, and interest, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees of
          any such action shall be added to the amount of such assessment. Each Owner, by his acceptance of a
          deed to a Townhouse Unit, hereby expressly vests in the Village Association, or its agents, the right
          and power to bring all actions against such Owner personally for the collection of such charges as a
          debt and to enforce the aforesaid lien by all methods available for the enforcement of such liens,
          including foreclosures by an action brought in the name of the Village Association in a like manner as
          a mortgage lien on a real property and such Owner hereby expressly grants to the Village Association
          a power of sale in connection with said lien. The lien provided for in this section shall be in favor of
          the Village Association and shall be for the benefit of all other Townhouse Unit Owners. The Village
          Association, acting on behalf of the Townhouse Unit Owners shall have the power to bid in an
          interest foreclosed at foreclosure sale and to acquire and hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same.
          Each Owner hereby assigns to the Association the rents and profits of such Owner's Townhouse Unit
          and grants to the Association the right to enter upon and to take possession of such Townhouse Unit
          for the purpose of collecting the same, to let the Townhouse Unit and to apply the rents therefrom,
          after payment of all necessary charges and expenses, on account of the assessment in arrears. This
          assignment and grant shall continue in effect until all assessment arrears are paid. In any action to
          foreclose the lien of the Association, the Association shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver.
          No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by non-
          use of the Common Area or abandonment of his Townhouse Unit.<br><br>
          Section 11. Subordination of The Lien to Mortgages. The lien of the assessments provided
          for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first mortgage on the Townhouse Unit. Sale or
          transfer of any Townhouse Unit shall not affect the assessment lien. The sale or transfer of any
          Townhouse Unit pursuant to foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof, shall
          extinguish the lien of such assessments as to payments which become due prior to such sale or
          transfer. No sale or transfer shall relieve such Townhouse Unit from liability for any assessments
          thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.<br><br>
          Section 12. Exempt Property. All properties dedicated to and accepted by, a local public
          authority, and the Common Area, shall be exempt from the assessments created herein. However, no
          land or improvements devoted to dwelling use shall be exempt from said assessments.<br><br>
          Section 13. Management Agreements. Each Owner of a Townhouse Unit hereby agrees to
          be bound by the terms and conditions of all management agreements entered into by the Village
          Association. A copy of all such agreements shall be available to each Owner.<br><br>
          Section 14. Insurance. The Board of Directors of the Village Association shall be
          empowered to secure such fire and extended coverage insurance and public liability insurance
          covering the Common Area and such other insurance coverage as the Board of Directors in their
          discretion may determine. The cost of such insurance coverage shall be an expense of the Village
          Association.<br><br>
          Section 15. Registration Fee. Beginning sixty days after the recording of this Declaration, all
          new Members shall be required to pay a $250 registration fee to the Village Association within 30
          days of becoming a Member. Such registration fee shall be billable and collectible in the same manner
          as maintenance assessments.<br>

          ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL<br>
          <br>
          (a) No building, fence, wall or other structure shall be commenced, erected or maintained
          upon the property, nor shall any exterior addition to or change or alteration therein be made until the
          plans and specifications showing nature, kind, shape, height, materials, and location of the same shall
          have been submitted to and approved in writing as to harmony of external design and location in
          relation to surrounding structures and topography by the Board of Directors of the Village
          Association, or by an Architectural Control Committee composed of three (3) or more representatives
          appointed by the Board. In the event said Board, or its designated committee, fails to approve or
          disapprove such design and location within seventy-five (75) days after said plans and specifications
          have been submitted to it, approval will not be required and this Article will be deemed to have been
          fully complied with.<br><br>
          (b) Approval of any proposed exterior addition or improvement may be conditioned upon the
          Owner's assumption of the sole responsibility for the repair and maintenance thereof, in which event,
          the Village Association shall have no obligation or responsibility for the repair and/or maintenance of
          such addition or improvement under Article VI hereof.<br><br>
          (c) In the event of any violation of this Article, the Village Association may initiate such
          actions or proceedings to enjoin such violation and/or to recover any damages resulting therefrom, as
          the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. In such event, the Village Association shall be
          entitled to recover from the offending Owner its reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred
          in the prosecution of any such action or proceeding, which shall constitute a lien upon such
          Townhouse Unit, and, in the event of the non-payment thereof, shall be recoverable in the same
          manner provided in Article IV for non-payment of assessments.<br><br>
          (d) In the event that any action or proceeding shall be commenced by any Owner against the
          Village Association, the Board of Directors and/or the Architectural Committee to compel the
          approval of any proposed construction, alteration or improvement, and such Owner is the
          unsuccessful party in such action or proceeding, the Village Association shall be entitled to recover
          from such Owner its reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in the defense of such
          action or proceeding, which shall constitute a lien upon such Townhouse Unit, and, in the event of the
          non-payment thereof, shall be recoverable in the same manner provided in Article IV for non-payment
          of assessments.<br>

          EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE<br>
          <br>
          Section 1. Maintenance of Individual Townhouse Units. In addition to maintenance of the
          Common Area, the Village Association shall provide exterior maintenance upon each Townhouse
          Unit which is subject to assessment hereunder, as follows: repair, replace and care for roofs, exterior
          building surfaces, trees, shrubs, grass, walks, and other exterior improvements which shall have been
          duly approved by the Board of Directors or Architectural Committee (unless such approval shall have
          been conditioned upon the Owner's assumption of responsibility for the maintenance and repair of
          such improvements). Such exterior maintenance shall not include any maintenance services other than
          those specified in the prior sentence, and shall exclude, glass surfaces, screens and screen doors,
          exterior doors, window fixtures and other hardware, foundations or parts thereof, any underground
          improvements or utility lines or any portions of the structure within the envelope bounded by the
          interior surface of the exterior siding, or any utility lines outside of the structure.
          In the event that the need for maintenance or repair is caused through the willful or negligent
          act (including, but not limited to the attachment of unauthorized structures or appliances to the
          exterior surfaces of the unit, or the imposition of an excessive weight load on any horizontal surface
          either by number of occupants permitted thereon or the weight of objects placed thereon) of the
          Owner, his family, guests, invitees, tenants or contract vendees, and not covered or paid for by
          insurance on such Townhouse Unit, the cost of such maintenance or repairs shall be added to and
          become a part of the assessment to which such Townhouse Unit Owner is subject.<br><br>
          Section 2. Additional Maintenance by Village Association. In the event an Owner of any
          Townhouse Unit shall fail to maintain the premises and the improvements situated thereon in a
          manner satisfactory to the Board of Directors, the Village Association, after approval of two-thirds
          (2/3) vote of the entire Board of Directors, shall have the right, through its agents and employees, to
          enter upon said property and to repair, maintain, and restore the Townhouse Unit. The cost of such
          maintenance shall be added to and become part of the assessment to which such Townhouse Unit is
          subject.<br>

          <br>

          Section 5. The Board of Directors may establish rules and regulations for the maintenance
          and storage of equipment, garbage cans, service yards, woodpiles, or storage piles and may require
          the screening thereof by adequate planting so as to conceal them from view of neighboring
          Townhouses, paths and roadways. All rubbish, trash or garbage shall be regularly removed from the
          premises, and shall not be allowed to accumulate thereon. No clotheslines or other devices for

          adopted by the Board of Directors of the Village Association. It is expressly acknowledged and

          point where the utility lines, pipes, wires, conduits or systems enter the exterior walls of a Townhouse
          Unit, shall be maintained and kept in repair by the Owner thereof. An Owner shall do no act nor any
          work that will impair the structural soundness or integrity of another Townhouse Unit or impair any
          easement or hereditament, nor do any act nor allow any condition to exist which will adversely affect
          the other Townhouse Units or their Owners.<br><br>
          Section 8. No exterior television or radio antennas of any sort shall be placed, allowed or
          maintained upon any portion of the improvements to be located upon the Property, nor upon any

          Members, if authorized by the affirmative votes of a majority of the Members cast in person or by
          proxy at a meeting duly called for such purpose.<br><br>
          Section 9. No action shall at any time be taken by the Village Association or its Board of

          PARTY FOUNDATION EASEMENTS<br>
          <br>
          Section 1. General Rules of Law to Apply. All Foundations which are built as a part of the
          original construction of the homes upon the Property and placed under the dividing line between the
          Townhouse Units or which serve as the foundation for two or more Townhouse Units shall constitute
          a party foundation, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, the general
          rules of law regarding party walls and liability for property damage due to negligence of willful acts or
          omissions shall apply thereto.<br><br>
          Section 2. Sharing of Repair and Maintenance. The cost of reasonable repair and

          Section 3. Destruction by Fire or Other Casualty. If a party foundation is destroyed or
          damaged by fire or other casualty then, to the extent that such damage is not covered by insurance
          and repaired out of the proceeds of same, any Owner who has used the foundation may restore it, and
          if the other Owners thereafter make use of the foundation, they shall contribute to the cost of
          restoration thereof in proportion to their use, without prejudice, however, to the right of any such
          Owners to call for a larger contribution from the others under any rules of law regarding liability for
          negligent or willful acts or omissions.<br><br>
          Section 4. Weatherproofing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the
          extent that such damage is not covered and paid by the insurance provided for herein, an Owner who
          by his negligent or willful act causes the foundation to be exposed to the elements, shall bear the
          whole cost of furnishing the necessary protection against such elements.<br><br>
          Section 5. Right to Contribution Runs With Land. The right of any Owner to contribution

          Section 6. Arbitration. In the event of any dispute arising concerning a party foundation, or
          under the provisions of this Article, each party shall choose one arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall

          any party refuse to appoint an arbitrator within ten days after written request therefor, the Board of
          Directors of the Village Association shall select an arbitrator for the refusing party.<br>

          encroachments created by construction, settling and overhangs, as designed or constructed by the
          Declarant. A valid easement for said encroachments and for the maintenance of same, so long as the
          structure stands, shall and does exist. In the event a multi-family structure containing two or more
          Townhouse Units is partially or totally destroyed, and then rebuilt, the Owners of the Townhouse
          Units so affected agree that minor encroachments of parts of the adjacent Townhouse Units or
          Common Areas due to construction shall be permitted and that a valid easement for said
          encroachment and the maintenance thereof shall exist.<br><br>
          Section 2. There is hereby created a blanket easement upon, across, over and under all of said
          Property for ingress, egress, installation, replacing, repairing and maintaining all utilities, including but

          of said Townhouses. An easement is further granted to all police, fire protection, ambulance and all
          similar persons to enter upon the roadways and Common Area in the performance of their duties.
          Further, an easement is hereby granted to the Village Association, its officers, agents, employees and
          to any management company selected by the Village Association to enter in or to cross over the
          Common Area and to enter any Townhouse Unit to inspect and to maintain and repair a Townhouse
          Unit or the Common Area provided for herein, to prevent damage to any other Townhouse Unit or
          the Common Area. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph, no
          additional sewers, electrical lines, water lines, or other utilities may be installed on said Property
          except as approved by the Village Association's Board of Directors. The easements provided for in
          this Article IX shall in no way affect any other recorded easement on said premises.<br>

      <div class="inner in-rent">
        <p>
          1. No weekend rental of a Townhouse Unit is permitted; only rentals for more than 13 days are allowed.  <br><br>
          2. Every advertisement or other offering for rental of a Townhouse Unit must state, in clearly legible
          font, “Rentals for less than 2 weeks are prohibited.” Failure to include such notice shall result in a

          shall be considered a separate violation (i.e., placing the same advertisement in 3 different  venues
          would constitute 3 violations). It shall be the renting Owner’s responsibility to inform their agents

          a violation by the Owner.  <br><br>
